# visiontrnf
This code leverages PyTorch for implementing a Vision Transformer and employs modular methods for visualizing attention maps, integrated gradients, saliency maps, and layer activations, using Matplotlib for visualizations and advanced analysis of mechanistic interpretability.

  ## Vision Transformer - Pytorch

Implementation of <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=YicbFdNTTy">Vision Transformer</a>, a simple way to achieve SOTA in vision classification with only a single transformer encoder, in Pytorch. Significance is further explained in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrdevFK_am4">Yannic Kilcher's</a> video. There's really not much to code here, but may as well lay it out for everyone so we expedite the attention revolution.

For a Pytorch implementation with pretrained models, please see Ross Wightman's repository <a href="https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models">here</a>.

A tensorflow2 translation also exists <a href="https://github.com/taki0112/vit-tensorflow">here</a>, created by research scientist <a href="https://github.com/taki0112">Junho Kim</a>! üôè

## Install

```bash
$ pip install vit-pytorch
```

## Usage

```python
import torch
from vit_pytorch import ViT

v = ViT(
    image_size = 256,
    patch_size = 32,
    num_classes = 1000,
    dim = 1024,
    depth = 6,
    heads = 16,
    mlp_dim = 2048,
    dropout = 0.1,
    emb_dropout = 0.1
)

img = torch.randn(1, 3, 256, 256)

preds = v(img) # (1, 1000)
```

## Parameters

- `image_size`: int.  
Image size. If you have rectangular images, make sure your image size is the maximum of the width and height
- `patch_size`: int.  
Size of patches. `image_size` must be divisible by `patch_size`.
The number of patches is: ` n = (image_size // patch_size) ** 2` and `n` **must be greater than 16**.
- `num_classes`: int.  
Number of classes to classify.
- `dim`: int.  
Last dimension of output tensor after linear transformation `nn.Linear(..., dim)`.
- `depth`: int.  
Number of Transformer blocks.
- `heads`: int.  
Number of heads in Multi-head Attention layer. 
- `mlp_dim`: int.  
Dimension of the MLP (FeedForward) layer. 
- `channels`: int, default `3`.  
Number of image's channels. 
- `dropout`: float between `[0, 1]`, default `0.`.  
Dropout rate. 
- `emb_dropout`: float between `[0, 1]`, default `0`.  
Embedding dropout rate.
- `pool`: string, either `cls` token pooling or `mean` pooling

## Simple ViT

<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01580">An update</a> from some of the same authors of the original paper proposes simplifications to `ViT` that allows it to train faster and better.

Among these simplifications include 2d sinusoidal positional embedding, global average pooling (no CLS token), no dropout, batch sizes of 1024 rather than 4096, and use of RandAugment and MixUp augmentations. They also show that a simple linear at the end is not significantly worse than the original MLP head

You can use it by importing the `SimpleViT` as shown below

```python
import torch
from vit_pytorch import SimpleViT

v = SimpleViT(
    image_size = 256,
    patch_size = 32,
    num_classes = 1000,
    dim = 1024,
    depth = 6,
    heads = 16,
    mlp_dim = 2048
)

img = torch.randn(1, 3, 256, 256)

preds = v(img) # (1, 1000)
```
